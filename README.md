# SDTrainingLabsCommunity
A wiki for members of the SD Training Labs Community. 

This is a github wiki/resource for members of the SD Training Labs discord community. 
Stable Diffusion and AI art are incredibly fast-moving fields, and new best practices and methods are constantly being discovered. 
We've started this wiki in hopes of recording what we've learned in our community, so that new users can get up to speed quickly and information can spread.

All are welcome to contribute!
